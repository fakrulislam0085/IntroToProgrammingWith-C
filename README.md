# IntroToProgrammingWithC 🚀

Welcome to my personal archive of C programming! This repository contains all the codes, exercises, and projects I completed during my journey learning the foundations of software development.

## 📁 Repository Structure
The repository is organized into three main categories to track my progress:

* **Modules:** Daily lessons and core concepts (Variables, Loops, Arrays, Pointers, etc.).
* **Conceptual Sessions:** Deep-dive sessions focusing on complex problem-solving and logic building.
* **Assignments:** Practical tasks and exams designed to test my understanding of each phase.

## 🛠️ Key Concepts Covered
- Fundamental Syntax & Data Types
- Conditional Logic & Loops
- Functions & Recursion
- Array and String Manipulation
- Pointers & Memory Management
- Structure and File Handling

## ⚙️ How I Built This
- **Language:** C
- **Compiler:** GCC
- **Version Control:** Managed via **Git Bash** to master the underlying logic of staging, committing, and branching.
- **Dashboard:** Visualized progress using **GitHub Desktop**.

## 🎯 Goal
The main goal of this repo is to maintain a clean record of my C programming roots while simultaneously leveling up my Git workflow and command-line skills.
